# Finable 🎙️💰

Welcome to Finable, a modern financial tracker that allows you to manage your expenses, budgets, and accounts entirely through voice commands. Say goodbye to tedious typing and hello to hands-free financial management.



## About The Project

Managing personal finances often involves manually entering data, navigating complex interfaces, and spending time that could be better used elsewhere. Finable was built to solve this problem. It provides an intuitive, accessible, and fast way to interact with your finances using the most natural interface: your voice.

Whether you're adding a new transaction, checking your monthly spending, or setting a budget, just speak your command, and Finable will handle the rest.
